## 💡 Overview

The healthcare industry requires timely and accurate predictions of patient health outcomes to improve patient care, optimize resource management, and support clinical decision-making. This project aims to build a predictive analytics system that processes healthcare data to make accurate predictions and offer insights to enhance patient treatment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Accurate Patient Risk Prediction:** Predict patient risks using health metrics like age, medical history, test results, and treatments.
- **Trend Identification:** Discover patterns to enhance preventive measures and personalized treatment.
- **Decision Support System:** Provide healthcare professionals with reliable insights.
- **Resource Optimization:** Identify high-risk patients for better resource allocation.
- **Scalability & Deployment:** Ensure easy integration of new data sources and models.

---

## 📌 Scope
- **Data Collection:** Structured healthcare data including demographics, medical history, tests, and treatments.
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Identify trends, correlations, and influential features.
- **Model Development:** Implement and optimize various machine learning models.
- **Deployment:** Interactive web application using Streamlit.
- **Monitoring & Maintenance:** Regular updates and retraining.
